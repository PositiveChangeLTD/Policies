These Terms & Conditions govern your access to and use of the Safe Days mobile application (“Safe Days App” or “App”), website, and related digital services including but not limited to our social media accounts and customer support platforms (collectively referred to as “Services”).

The term “Safe Days,” “Company,” “we,” or “us” refers to the legal entity incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom. The terms “user,” “you,” or “your” refer to any individual who uses or accesses our Services.

By downloading, installing, registering for, or otherwise using our Services, you are deemed to have accepted these Terms & Conditions. If you do not agree to these Terms in full, you must not access or use the Services.

Use of our Services is also subject to our Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference and available [here](https://positivechangeltd.github.io/Policies/privacy-policy.html).

### 1. General Use and Licensing

The Safe Days App is licensed to you, not sold. We provide you with a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download and use the App on devices you own or control, in accordance with these Terms and any usage rules set by your device's app store provider (the “Provider”).

We (and our licensors, where applicable) retain ownership of all intellectual property rights associated with the App and Services, including content, design, functionality, logos, text, graphics, and other related elements.

---

### 2. Account, Access, and Subscriptions

While registration is not required for all features, accessing full functionality of the App requires login via your Apple ID or other Provider login credentials. Use of your Provider account is subject to their terms, and any issues regarding account access, billing, or subscriptions must be addressed directly with them.

Safe Days offers a Premium subscription that includes additional features and services not available in the free version. These may include advanced fertility predictions, data exports, custom reminders, or other exclusive content.

By subscribing, you authorize Safe Days and the Provider to charge your payment method for the applicable fees. Subscriptions are billed in advance and renew automatically unless canceled before the end of the billing cycle.

You may cancel your Premium subscription via your App Store settings. Uninstalling the App or deleting your account does not automatically cancel your subscription.

Safe Days has no access to your payment or billing information handled by Providers like Apple Inc., and cannot issue refunds. All refund requests must be directed to the relevant Provider.

---

### 3. Eligibility and Age Requirements

The Safe Days App is intended for individuals aged seventeen (17) or older. If local laws in your jurisdiction require a higher minimum age for data processing without parental consent, you must comply with that age requirement.

If you are underage or otherwise prohibited from using the Services under applicable laws, you may not use the App.

### 5. Medical Disclaimer and Pregnancy Notice

**The Safe Days App is not a form of contraception and does not provide medical advice or medical guarantees.**

The App provides fertility and menstrual cycle predictions based on self-reported user data. These predictions are algorithmic and **not clinically verified or intended to prevent pregnancy**. Safe Days is not a healthcare provider, nor is it a substitute for medical care, diagnosis, or consultation.

**YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT SAFE DAYS SHALL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY PREGNANCY THAT OCCURS WHILE USING THE SERVICES.**

We do not claim or guarantee that the use of the App will prevent conception, nor do we recommend using Safe Days as a standalone method for birth control.

You should always consult a qualified healthcare provider before making decisions related to your reproductive health, especially if you:

- Are trying to conceive;
- Are avoiding pregnancy;
- Have irregular cycles or hormonal conditions;
- Have been diagnosed with PCOS, endometriosis, or other reproductive conditions;
- Have recently stopped hormonal contraception or undergone a medical procedure affecting fertility.

If you are pregnant or suspect you may be pregnant, discontinue use and consult a medical professional. If you are experiencing distress related to reproductive or mental health, please seek immediate medical support.
